# Hero Studio

This project is an attempt to build an studio similar to Bitwig Studio or Ableton Live.

Initially the scope will be reduced to only MIDI, and there will be a different way to arrange the clips.

How the UI will be build is still very uncertain.

## Organisation

This is a multi-project composed by:

- [core](core): The core data model and logic.

More sub-projects will come depending on how I decide to build the UI.

## Tests

Tests can be run with:

```
cargo test
```
